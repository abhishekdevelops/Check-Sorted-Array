# 🔍 Check if Array is Sorted – JavaScript Logic Project

This beginner-friendly JavaScript project checks whether a given array is sorted in **ascending order**. It uses a simple loop and comparison logic to evaluate the sequence and prints the result in the browser console.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Verifies if an array is sorted from smallest to largest
- Uses loop and conditionals (no built-in sort methods)
- Clean output displayed in browser console
- Great practice for JavaScript logic building

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Working with arrays
- Looping through elements
- Conditional comparison using `array[i] > array[i + 1]`
- Flag-based status checking (`isSorted` logic)

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Open the browser's **Developer Console**:

## 🧪 Example Output

For array `[2, 4, 6, 9]`:
```
✅ Array is sorted in ascending order
```

For array `[5, 3, 8, 2]`:
```
❌ Array is NOT sorted
```
